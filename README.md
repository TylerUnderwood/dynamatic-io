# [Dynamatic](https://dynamatic.io/)

Dynamatic is a modern design system, built from external theme tokens. The goal is to create a base floor for others to build their own frameworks around it.

## Big picture to-dos
- [x] Use a json object to generate native css tokens
- [x] Migrate my original boilerplate from it's Laravel app, to this vue one
- [ ] Move dynamatic specific elements to node_package repo
- [ ] Compleat documentation for all components
- [ ] Convert scss to css and postcss
- [ ] Get feedback on organization and structure

## Possible slogans/quips
- Rapid prototyping, minus the prototype
- Write less css
